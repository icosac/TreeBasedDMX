# TreeBasedDMX
Project from Distributed System 1 based on "A Tree-Based Algorithm for Distributed Mutual Exclusion" from Kerry Raymond. 

## Warnings 
The folder `logs` must be present before starting the execution with `gradle run` otherwise it will print an error.

Two example are given, the first (`tree.conf`) is a list of neighbors, the second is an xml file (`tree_xml.conf`) which needs to be renamed to `tree.conf` before executing. Also two commands list files are given, the `commands_xml.conf`one needs to be renamed to `commands.conf` before executing. To create new files in xml, the tested "protocol" consists in exporting from https://graphonline.ru/en/ and formatting in https://www.freeformatter.com/xml-formatter.html.
